                <h3>The Fine Features Of Android 11</h3>
                <h4>Built-In Screen Recorder</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>No more in need of third party apps for screen recordings, as it is natively available with Android 11. Android 11 wishes to make recording calls, audios, or videos from your phone as easy as possible.</li>
                    <li>To enable the new screen recorder tool to appear in the quick settings panel, you may first need to edit the settings and add it to the top menu slider.</li>
                    <li>It records content on your device including the audio from your mic, device, or both, and limits the need of having to install a separate app.</li>
                    <li>On enabling record audio if you want to customize, then use the dropdown menu to pick whether it records from your microphone, your device audio, or both. Turn on 'show touches' on the screen if you want to display labels wherever you touch.</li>
                    <li>A red dot on the <a href="#">status</a> bar at the top of the screen lets you know that the recording is in progress and it allows you to stop it at any time. </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Separate Message Notifications</h4>
